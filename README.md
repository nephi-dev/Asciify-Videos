# Asciify-Videos
Used to transform entire videos in ascii letters

# How to
To use, put all the files in a folder and then run "master.py" file  
after that paste your file path into the terminal and press enter  
then wait to the video be "asciified"

# Requirements
--> Python(obviously)  
--> opencv-python  
--> Pillow  
--> numpy

# Steps
First the script load all the frames of the video, pass then to the asciify algorithm  
after that, every frame from video will create a new image, that will be used to create the new video  
finally the new video will be created ate the same locale of your "master.py" file

# TODO
> Make possible to load videos from web links
